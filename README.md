# GameRecommender

# PLEASE NOTE: If you would like to interact with the UI you will need to follow the installation steps below. The Jupyter Notebook file will not render the UI in GitHub.

## Application Description and Machine Learning Algorithms Used
The GameRecommender application utilizes machine learning techniques to address the challenge of recommending video games to users based on their owned games. 

* **Data Preprocessing:** The application preprocesses the 'tags' and 'genre' columns of the game dataset. The 'tags' column, containing comma-separated lists of tags, is converted into a space-separated string. The 'genre' column, initially a list of genres, is transformed into a string representation. Additionally, the 'votes' column is normalized using the MinMaxScaler to ensure consistency in the feature space.


* **Feature Extraction:** The preprocessed data is combined to create a feature representation for each game. The features consist of the tags, genre, normalized votes, and rating. This feature engineering process aims to capture the essential characteristics of each game.


* **Clustering:** The application applies the K-means clustering algorithm to the document-term matrix created using TF-IDF vectorization. The number of clusters is set to five in this implementation. The clustering algorithm groups similar games together based on their extracted features, forming distinct clusters.


* **Cluster Assignment:** The resulting cluster labels are assigned to each game in the original dataset, stored in the 'cluster_label' column. This assignment enables efficient retrieval of games belonging to the same cluster as the selected games.


* **Game Features Mapping:** A dictionary, 'game_features_mapping,' is created to map game titles to their corresponding tags. This mapping allows for quick access to the features of each game.


* **TF-IDF Vectorization:** The application employs a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the game features into a numerical representation suitable for computing cosine similarity.


* **Recommendations Generation:** When the user selects specific games, the application retrieves their corresponding cluster labels. It identifies similar games by comparing the cluster labels and excluding the selected games. The TF-IDF representations of the selected games' features and the similar games' features are calculated using the vectorizer. The cosine similarity between these representations is computed using the cosine_similarity function. The similar games are then ranked based on their similarity scores, and the top 10 recommendations are displayed.

## Installation
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. If you do not have Docker Desktop go to: docs.docker.com/engine/install and install the Docker
Desktop Platform for your OS
3. Once Docker is installed open Docker Desktop
4. Open your terminal/Command Prompt
5. Enter the following command and run: ```docker pull v2jc/game-recommender:v1.0```
6. Enter the following command and run: ```docker run -p 8888:8888 v2jc/game-recommender:v1.0```
7. Once this is completed you will be given 3 different URLs, copy and paste one URL into your browser address bar until the Jupyter Notebooks page successfully loads
8. Select the ```GameRecommender.ipynb``` file
9. Step through each cell by selecting ```Run```
10. Interact with the UI at the bottom of the webpage to build a list of games and get
recommendations based on your list
